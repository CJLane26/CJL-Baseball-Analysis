This is my first go at baseball analytics with R and RMarkdown using the https://github.com/BillPetti/baseballr library. 

# Please visit [https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/CJLane26/Phillies-Analysis/blob/main/2023%20Phillies%20wOBA/Phillies_2023_wOBA_Report.html] to view the html output version of the report.

The goal was to parse the 2023 Phillies batter data and create a markdown report of the rolling 10-day wOBA of the starting lineup and team average.

Attached .pdf is the printed version of the html document created by knitting the markdown file. As it is a .pdf saved copy of the html file, it lacks much of the trappings of the actual .html output created when the file is run. However, uploading just the .html file displayed code rather than the report.
