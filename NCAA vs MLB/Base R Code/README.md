This folder contains all the base R files to recreate the results presented in the RMarkdown file and output. By running the **NCAA_vs_MLB.R** file, you can repeat this analysis in your own environment.

Note: The code may take a while to run in full (~7-10 minutes) because of the number of API calls and potential timeouts (when timed out, the code will wait a few seconds and resubmit the same call).
